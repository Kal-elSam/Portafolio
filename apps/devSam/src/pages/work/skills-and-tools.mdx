I started my career as a mechanical engineer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years ago**. I worked as a SM/PM/PO for the next 4 years and in 2021 I decided to make a radical change and move into the area of technology and web development.

Although the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **Mobile Development**.

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### JavaScript 

First of all, the programming language. I am using constantly used to use **JavaScript** y **TypeScript**, although the creation of websites can be done some other technology.

### React

I really like building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2021 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years)** and I keep getting better every day.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({2023 - 2021} years).

I'm still new to Tailwind CSS, but **I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Next.js

I have been using it recently, and discovering it is something that has helped me a lot to understand the use of web frameworks. **It's very good**, but always open to learn something new.

## Mobile Development: Flutter

In addition to being a Frontend Developer, I've also ventured into the world of mobile development, specifically with Flutter.

I love the ease with which I can create cross-platform apps with a single codebase. Although I'm still in the learning stage, I feel comfortable using Flutter and am excited about all that I can achieve with this tool.

## SM/PM/PO

With 4 years of project management experience as a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Project Manager, I am a highly qualified professional committed to project success. My expertise in agile methodologies and a Master's in Project Management enables effective team leadership and problem-solving.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
