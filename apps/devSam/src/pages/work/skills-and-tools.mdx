Transitioning from mechanical engineering to technology and web development in 2021, I've focused on **Front-End Development** and **Mobile Development**, diving deep into creating user-centric solutions.

## Front-End Developer

I'm drawn to crafting clean, minimalistic, and valuable interfaces that are user-friendly. My journey includes creating:

- **Web applications**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layouts**,
- **Landing pages**.


### JavaScript 

First of all, the programming language. I am using constantly used to use **JavaScript** y **TypeScript**, although the creation of websites can be done some other technology.

### React

I really like building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2021 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years)** and I keep getting better every day.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({2023 - 2021} years).

I'm still new to Tailwind CSS, but **I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Next.js

I have been using it recently, and discovering it is something that has helped me a lot to understand the use of web frameworks. **It's very good**, but always open to learn something new.

## Mobile Development: Flutter

In addition to being a Frontend Developer, I've also ventured into the world of mobile development, specifically with Flutter.

I love the ease with which I can create cross-platform apps with a single codebase. Although I'm still in the learning stage, I feel comfortable using Flutter and am excited about all that I can achieve with this tool.

## SM/PM/PO

With 4 years of project management experience as a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Project Manager, I am a highly qualified professional committed to project success. My expertise in agile methodologies and a Master's in Project Management enables effective team leadership and problem-solving.
