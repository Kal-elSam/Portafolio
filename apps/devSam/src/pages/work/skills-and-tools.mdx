Transitioning from mechanical engineering to technology and web development in 2021, I've focused on **Front-End Development** and **Mobile Development**, diving deep into creating user-centric solutions.

## Front-End Development

I'm drawn to crafting clean, minimalistic, and valuable interfaces that are user-friendly. My journey includes creating:

- **Web applications**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layouts**,
- **Landing pages**.

### Tools and Technologies

#### JavaScript and TypeScript

My main programming languages for building dynamic websites and applications.

#### React

My preferred library for building single-page applications, offering rich UI components. Experience: **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years**.

#### Tailwind CSS

A utility-first CSS framework that I've embraced for its efficiency in styling, despite my longer experience with SCSS.

#### Next.js

A React framework that I've recently adopted, enhancing my skills in server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Mobile Development with Flutter

Exploring mobile development through Flutter has allowed me to create cross-platform applications efficiently. While still learning, I'm adept at utilizing Flutter to build robust mobile apps.

## Tools Proficiency

I've adapted to various development tools and technologies to streamline my work, with a focus on efficiency and collaboration.
